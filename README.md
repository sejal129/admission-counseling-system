# Online Admission and Counseling System

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a web-based service to make the Admission and Counseling System online. It reduces the risk of paperwork such as file loss, file damaged, and time consumption. This will reshape the complete process, which helps in reducing overhead on the management system.

The objective of this project is to keep track of the information and handle the details of the students online. This will provide an interface to different universities to shape their management system. The main part of the project is to provide a preferred branch to the students according to their eligibility as it is a crucial part of the admission process. The whole process is handled in the backend. This website is mainly aimed towards interested students, who seek admission to the university. This will make the whole admission and counseling system easy and feasible for students as well as administration.

## Testing
Software testing can be stated as the process of validating ad verifying that a software program/ application/ product:

1. Meets the requirements that guided its design and development;
2. Works as expected; and
3. Can be implemented with the same characteristics.

Testing is the process of making sure that the program performs the intended tasks.
1. **Unit Testing**: Each component or part of the system is tested individually.
2. **Module Testing**: A collection of dependent components such as an object class, procedures, and functions are tested in this testing.
3. **Integration Testing**: In this, many units tested modules are combined into subsystems, which are then tested.
4. **System Testing**: Entire system software is tested. It is a testing of the system against its initial objectives.
